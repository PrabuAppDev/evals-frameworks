    "**Factual Correctness Result: 1.0**\n",
    "- The model's response was **factually correct** and aligned well with the expected answer.\n",

    "- The response provided relevant facts based on known data (e.g., USDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Faithfulness Result: 0.75**\n",
    "- The faithfulness score of **0.75** suggests that the model's response was **mostly faithful** to the retrieved context and the expected information.\n",
    "- However, there is room for improvement to ensure the response is fully aligned with the given context, especially if the retrieved context could be more clearly reflected in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AspectCritic Result: 1**\n",
    "- The **aspect critic** check passed, indicating that the response was **consistent** with the general criteria for a well-formed, factually supported answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- The model performed well in providing a **factually correct** response but can be further improved in terms of **faithfulness**. Ensuring that the retrieved context is fully reflected in the response would enhance faithfulness.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The **aspect critic** check passed, confirming that the response adhered to the expected format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the approach is largely successful, with **hallucinations** avoided, but there is still room for improvement in **faithfulness**."
