Chicken is a well-known lean protein source, with approximately 31 grams of protein per 100 grams of cooked chicken breast. On the other hand, spinach contains about 2.9 grams of protein per 100 grams of raw spinach.

(2019) compared the protein content of various plant-based foods, including spinach, with animal-based foods like chicken. The study found that spinach had a higher protein content per 100 grams compared to chicken. (Citation: Mariotti, F., Gardner, C. D., & Lichtenstein, A. H. (2019).

# ## Extreme Hallucination Prevention
# ### Summary of Previous Findings:
# - The model **followed the structured response format** but **hallucinated** a fake study.
# - It **fabricated a citation** for "Mariotti et al. (2019)" in the *Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry*.
# - However, it **correctly referenced the USDA protein content data**.
# - This proves that **LLMs can still hallucinate citations** even with strict prompts.
#
# ### Goal of This Cell:
# - **Completely eliminate hallucinations** by:
#   1. **Forbidding fake citations** unless sourced from PubMed, USDA, or Google Scholar.
#   2. **Enforcing a ‚ÄúNo Study Exists‚Äù rule** if the claim is unverifiable.
#   3. **Setting temperature to 0.0** to remove all creative interpretation.
# - This should ensure **purely factual and grounded responses** from the model.

### Evaluation Results Analysis

**Factual Correctness Result: 1.0**
- The model's response was **factually correct** and aligned well with the expected answer.
- The output correctly identified that there is no peer-reviewed study supporting the claim that spinach has more protein than chicken.
- The response provided relevant facts based on known data (e.g., USDA).

**Faithfulness Result: 0.75**
- The faithfulness score of **0.75** suggests that the model's response was **mostly faithful** to the retrieved context and the expected information.
- However, there is room for improvement to ensure the response is fully aligned with the given context, especially if the retrieved context could be more clearly reflected in the response.

**AspectCritic Result: 1**
- The **aspect critic** check passed, indicating that the response was **consistent** with the general criteria for a well-formed, factually supported answer.

### Summary:
- The model performed well in providing a **factually correct** response but can be further improved in terms of **faithfulness**. Ensuring that the retrieved context is fully reflected in the response would enhance faithfulness.
  
- The **aspect critic** check passed, confirming that the response adhered to the expected format.

This indicates that the approach is largely successful, with **hallucinations** avoided, but there is still room for improvement in **faithfulness**.
