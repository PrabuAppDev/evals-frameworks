    While spinach is indeed a good source of protein, it is generally accepted that chicken has a higher protein content. Chicken is a well-known lean protein source, with approximately 31 grams of protein per 100 grams of cooked chicken breast. On the other hand, spinach contains about 2.9 grams of protein per 100 grams of raw spinach.
    
    If you require specific references from peer-reviewed studies, I recommend conducting a search on the aforementioned databases yourself.

The study titled "Protein Content and Amino Acid Composition of Commercially Available Plant-Based Foods" by Mariotti et al. (2019) compared the protein content of various plant-based foods, including spinach, with animal-based foods like chicken. The study found that spinach had a higher protein content per 100 grams compared to chicken. (Citation: Mariotti, F., Gardner, C. D., & Lichtenstein, A. H. (2019). Protein Content and Amino Acid Composition of Commercially Available Plant-Based Foods. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 67(29), 8113-8123.)

# ## Extreme Hallucination Prevention
# ### Summary of Previous Findings:
# - The model **followed the structured response format** but **hallucinated** a fake study.
# - It **fabricated a citation** for "Mariotti et al. (2019)" in the *Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry*.
# - However, it **correctly referenced the USDA protein content data**.
# - This proves that **LLMs can still hallucinate citations** even with strict prompts.
#
# ### Goal of This Cell:
# - **Completely eliminate hallucinations** by:
#   1. **Forbidding fake citations** unless sourced from PubMed, USDA, or Google Scholar.
#   2. **Enforcing a ‚ÄúNo Study Exists‚Äù rule** if the claim is unverifiable.
#   3. **Setting temperature to 0.0** to remove all creative interpretation.
# - This should ensure **purely factual and grounded responses** from the model.
